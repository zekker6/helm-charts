# The public-facing base URL that clients use to access this HS

# List of ports that Synapse should listen on, their purpose and their
# configuration.
#
# Sub-options for each listener include:
#
# * `port`: the TCP port to bind to.
# * `bind_addresses`: a list of local addresses to listen on. The default is
#      'all local interfaces'.
# * `type`: the type of listener. Normally `http`, but other valid options are:
#
#             * `manhole`: (see the docs [here](../../manhole.md)),
#
#             * `metrics`: (see the docs [here](../../metrics-howto.md)),
# * `tls`: set to true to enable TLS for this listener. Will use the TLS key/cert specified in tls_private_key_path / tls_certificate_path.
# * `x_forwarded`: Only valid for an 'http' listener. Set to true to use the X-Forwarded-For header as the client IP. Useful when Synapse is
#      behind a [reverse-proxy](../../reverse_proxy.md).
# * `request_id_header`: The header extracted from each incoming request that is
#                          used as the basis for the request ID. The request ID is used in
# [logs](../administration/request_log.md#request-log-format) and tracing to
#                          correlate and match up requests. When unset, Synapse will automatically
#                          generate sequential request IDs. This option is useful when Synapse is behind
#                          a [reverse-proxy](../../reverse_proxy.md).
#
#                          _Added in Synapse 1.68.0._
#
# * `resources`: Only valid for an 'http' listener. A list of resources to host
#         on this port. Sub-options for each resource are:
#
#      * `names`: a list of names of HTTP resources. See below for a list of valid resource names.
#
#      * `compress`: set to true to enable gzip compression on HTTP bodies for this resource. This is currently only supported with the
#           `client`, `consent`, `metrics` and `federation` resources.
#
# * `additional_resources`: Only valid for an 'http' listener. A map of
#      additional endpoints which should be loaded via dynamic modules.
#
# Valid resource names are:
# * `client`: the client-server API (/_matrix/client), and the synapse admin API (/_synapse/admin). Also implies `media` and `static`.
# * `consent`: user consent forms (/_matrix/consent). See [here](../../consent_tracking.md) for more.
# * `federation`: the server-server API (/_matrix/federation). Also implies `media`, `keys`, `openid`
# * `keys`: the key discovery API (/_matrix/key).
# * `media`: the media API (/_matrix/media).
# * `metrics`: the metrics interface. See [here](../../metrics-howto.md).
# * `openid`: OpenID authentication. See [here](../../openid.md).
# * `replication`: the HTTP replication API (/_synapse/replication). See [here](../../workers.md).
# * `static`: static resources under synapse/static (/_matrix/static). (Mostly useful for 'fallback authentication'.)

#
# When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.
#
# Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS certificates.
# Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`, which
# will make synapse check that the response is signed by that key.
#
# This setting supercedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old format
# is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated.
#
# 'trusted_key_servers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
# warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
# 'suppress_key_server_warning' to true.
#
# Options for each entry in the list include:
#
#    server_name: the name of the server. required.
#
#    verify_keys: an optional map from key id to base64-encoded public key.
#       If specified, we will check that the response is signed by at least
#       one of the given keys.
#
#    accept_keys_insecurely: a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset,
#       and federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will refuse
#       to start, because this would allow anyone who can spoof DNS responses
#       to masquerade as the trusted key server. If you know what you are doing
#       and are sure that your network environment provides a secure connection
#       to the key server, you can set this to `true` to override this
#       behaviour.
#
# An example configuration might look like:
#
#trusted_key_servers:
#  - server_name: "my_trusted_server.example.com"
